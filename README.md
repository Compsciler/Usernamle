# Usernamle

Guess the username in 10 tries. After each guess, the color of the tiles will
change to show how close your guess was to the username. 

You may input any sequence of characters for each guess.
Playing on PC is recommended.

Some of the characters in the username will be revealed as a clue.
The username comes from one of the 10,000 users by comment count on Reddit (as of November 2017). 
Hyphens in the username are replaced by underscores.
